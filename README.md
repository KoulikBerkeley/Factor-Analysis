# Factor-Anlaysis

Here we include the codes for the factor analysis (FA) method 
that we proposed in paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05935. 

We include two functions for the proposed FA method; the first one 
is for smaller/ moderate dimensions and the second one is used when data dimension 
is very large. For details please refer the paper. 

For initialization instructions, please refer to the code files.
