# Factor-Anlaysis

Here we include the codes for the factor analysis (FA) method method
that we proposed in paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05935. 

We prepared two functions for the proposed FA method; the first one 
is for smaller dimensions and the second one is uded when data dimension 
is very large. For details please refer the paper. 

For initialization instructions, please refer to the code files.
