# Factor-Anlaysis

Here we include the codes for the factor analysis (FA) method method
that we proposed in paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05935. 

We prepared two functions for the proposed FA method; the first one 
is for n>p and the second one is uded for n<p. Here 
n --- sample size for the model.
p --- dimension of the model. 

For initialization instructions, please refer to the code files.
